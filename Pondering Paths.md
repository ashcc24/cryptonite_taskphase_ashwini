# Root
once connected, entered /pwn and flag captured 
# Program and Absolute Paths 
put /challenge/run and captured flag
# Position thy self
entered /challenge/run and it gave a location. used cd to go there then ran /challenge/run again
repeated same for position elsewhere and position yet elsewhere
# implicit relative paths using /
did cd / to change directory, then used challenge/run instead of /challenge/run.
# explicit relative paths using /
used /./challenge/run as given in instructions 
# impicit relative path
first i used cd /challenge to change directory, then used ./run to run it without error
# home sweet home 
i used /challenge/run and then wrote ~/f so that ~ would expand to home/hacker and would write to file f which then gave me the flag as 'reading it back to you'
