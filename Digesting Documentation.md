i used /chalenge/challenge --giveflag as it was told to be passed as an argument along with the command 

# learning from complex usage 
flag - pwn.college{kwMXilr2zcw6WLZCAjPS0No8TvK.dVjM5QDLzcjN0czW}
it took a bt of back and forth to figure it out, but I used ls which confused me with the results. I then used cd / and ls again and found the flag. I then used the given syntax with the path as flag and found it. 

# reading manuals
flag- pwn.college{QRkYmnk2MaSJ-F0IiaVrIwBqNim.dRTM4QDLzcjN0czW}
I used man challenge and used --kmnkai NUM but it took me some time to realise i need to input the number in place of NUM, but once i fgured that out i got it

# searching manuals
flag- pwn.college{8CCrnp4CqJlAerNwbcDdT2ayfT4.dVTM4QDLzcjN0czW}
afer using man challenge, for a while i tried to manually search through for a while before using search option with the word flag. It led me to the command --esh which i used to find the flag.

i found this hard as it was a lot of information to sort through. after using man man I tried a lot of different commands before finally landiing on the -k command. I used it to look for descriptions with the word flag. I then looked through to find one which said 'print the flag' and I opened up that one. I then used cd / and used the command given to obtain the flag. 

# helpful programs 
flag- pwn.college{0HwNeFCBe7SUO-w583Ho_RMaaiR.ddjM4QDLzcjN0czW}
i used /challenge/challenge --help to open the help section. I then read through and first used a command to get the secret number, and then used that to give me the flag with another command. 

# help for builtins 
flag- pwn.college{Ub9IcnVv53yDHolseLcFydzlI3l.dRTM5QDLzcjN0czW}
i used the help command to find information about all the builtins and found challenge. I then expanded it and found the secret value which I used to get the flag.
